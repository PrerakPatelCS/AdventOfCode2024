Advent Of Code 2024

# Days

1. Easy
2. Learned about unpacking in python.
   Optimization, fix the first mistake.
3. Parsing wall of text, interesting solution finite state machine or regex.
4. Find XMAS in word search, and then MAS in a X shape in the word search.
   Cool optimization where you make all coordinates an entry in a map so you
   never need to do out of bounds checks.
5. Make the rules set.
   You can make a custom comparator because the input is given as a total
   ordering.
6. Find where the Guard will go.
   Worked with the matrix with complex numbers so we can add and subtract easily
   and for fun.
   There are some optimizations for the possible spots.
7. Backtracking.
8. Anntennas, complex numbers and map trick.
9. Getting rid of Internal fragmentation, but part 2 make more internal
   fragmentation?
10. Find Paths from 0 to 9s
11. Dynamic programming, stones change for every blink
12. Find Perimeter and then find number of sides.
    Number of sides can be solved many different ways I chose to use math and
    figure out the number of corners which has 2 edge cases you can figure them
    out!
13. Linear Algebra solving a system of linear equations, very fun.
14. Figure out where the christmas tree is.
    I used hueristics to find it.
    There is also a math solution with Chinese Remainder Theorem.
15. Robot moves through a matrix and moves blocks, what happens when it becomes
    twice as wide and the robot has to deal with edges where you can push
    boxes from their edge.
16. Find the fastest route from S to E, djikstras and then use DFS knowing the
    best route so you can find all of the fastest routes.
17.
